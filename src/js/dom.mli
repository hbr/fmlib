        Document                        Text node

    I.e. a document is an element which is a node which is an event target. A text
    node is an event target as well.

    Each document has a body element which is the root of the visible document.

    Nodes can form a tree. I.e. each node has an optional parent, an optional
    first child and an optional sibling. There are methods to add and remove
    children from a node.

    {e Note:} Use the code only within a browser window. Never in node and never
    in a worker thread.

(** A node in the dom tree. *)
module Node:

        [parent]

        If [child] is already a child of another node, it is removed from the

    *)

    *)

    val remove: string -> t -> unit
    (** [remove name style] Remove the property [name] from [style]. *)
end






(** Element node. *)
module Element:
sig
    type t
    (** Type of an element node. *)

    val node:  t -> Node.t
    (** Element viewed as a node. All elements are nodes, therefore no
        conversion is necessary. *)

    val set_property:     string -> Base.Value.t -> t -> unit
    (** [set_property name value element] Set the property [name] to [value] in
        [element].

        The distinction between attributes and properties is subtle. Attribute
        have always a string value and implicitely set the corresponding
        property as well. A property can have any javascript value and does not
        set the corresponding attribute, even if the property has a string
        value.

        Examples:
        {[
            set_property "value" "my-text" input_element

    (** The body of the document.

        Precondition: The document must have been loaded!

        Never call this function before the page has been loaded.
    *)


    val find: string -> t -> Element.t option
    (** [find id doc] Find the element with the id attribute [id] in the
        document [doc]. Uses the javascript method [getElementById]. *)


    val create_element:   string -> t -> Element.t
    (** [create_element tag doc] Create a new element with [tag]. *)

    val create_text_node: string -> t -> Node.t
    (** [create_text_node text doc] Create a new text node with content [text]. *)


    val create_element_ns: string -> string -> t -> Element.t
    (** [create_element_ns namespace name doc]

        Like [create_element], but creates the element within a namespace, e.g.
        "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg".
     *)

    val create_document_fragment: t -> Node.t
    (** Create a new document fragment.

        A document fragment is a special node with no parent. Adding children to
        the fragment does not affect the dom i.e. does not cause reflow and
        repaint, because the fragment is not part of the active dom.

        If you call
        {[
            node.append(fragment)
        ]}
        all the children the [fragment] are appended to [node] instead of the
        fragment, leaving an empty fragment behind.

        The title is ignored by many browsers.

        The url can be relative or absolute. If its relative, it is resolved
        relative to the current url.

        Precondition: [url] must be of the same origin as the current url.

        The state is included in the corresponding popstate event as [state]
        property. The popstate event fires if the user navigates to the
        corresponding url.

        {e Note:} Neither [push_state] nor [replace_state] do trigger a popstate
        event. A popstate event is triggered only by navigation (back, forward
        button). At the popstate event the new location has already been set.
